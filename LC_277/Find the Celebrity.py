"""
Among a party of n people, there may exist one celebrity, someone who all the 
other n - 1 people know him, but he does not know any of them. Now you want to 
find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one.

You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows 
B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n). Return the celebrity's label if 
there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
